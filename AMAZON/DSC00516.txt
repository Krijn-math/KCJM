In Cuyabeno, we were staying in the aptly named
Tucan Eco-lodge. So we couldn't leave the place
if we hadn't seen one of those beautiful tucans

We were out of luck for the first few days...
We could sometimes spot some in the distance,
but they were always just out of reach for my
camera, or hiding perfectly behind a branch.
On the final day, when we were getting ready 
to head back, this guy decided to show up and
finally gave us the perfect shot in the sunset
