According to our guide, there are five species of kingfishers
that are possible to spot in the Cuyabeno part of the Amazon,
and all of them are beauties, like this one with his mohawk.

This species is rather large, the Ringed Kingfisher. In Dutch
the name is perhaps better, the 'Amerikaanse reuzenijsvogel.'
We spotted it during a nightly trip down the river in canoe.
