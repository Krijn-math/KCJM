I really, really, really, really love turtles.
So you can imagine how happy I was to see them
do a little conga in the Rio Aguarico when we 
were on our way back home, a long trip by canoe.

Lined up like this, they maximize their exposure
on this small branch of wood that's carries them.
The butterfly isn't there just for the company,
but will drink their tears to replenish her salts
and minerals, in a symbiotic relationship called
lachryphagya, which gives the turtle clean eyes!
