It's impossible not to like hummingbirds.
With their incredible manoeuvrability and
beautiful colors, they are both a blessing
and a curse for hobby nature photographers.

Luckily, these little feeders attract them
with just the tiniest bit of sugary water. 
When they will sit still for a tiny moment,
I quickly took this picture of this beauty.
