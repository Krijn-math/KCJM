When you go out at night, you discover that the
Rio Aguarico in Cuyabeno has more than just fish

These Black Caiman float silently through the water,
or crawl up on the river beds. Surprisingly, you can
get fairly close to them, up to a few meters, before
they dive off under water. I'm not following them in.
