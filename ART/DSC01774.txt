This is the 'Spoorwegmonument' (1984)
by Christian Daniel Rauch (1777 - 1857).

Depicting the godess Victoria, this is a
copy of the statue made for the Walhalla,
close to Regensburg. She stands close to
the Valkhofpark in Nijmegen, which means
that I pass by her almost every day when
I go out for a run, or for photography.
