This is ‘Saint Joseph’ (1635),
by Jusepe de Ribera (1591 - 1652),
in the Louvre (AD).

We see Saint Joseph as an old man, 
looking up in wonder at the miracle
that has just happended before him.

The painting captures his amazement
beautifully, with spontaneity, and
strong influences from Caravaggio.
