This is 'The Walking Man' (1907)
by Auguste Rodin (1840 - 1917),
on the outside of Louvre (AD).

Although the figure looks like an
ancient Greek sculpture on first
view, the dynamic pose caused by
the disbalanced body are entirely
unclassical. This focus on what
Rodin considers essential marks
the latter part of his career.
