I believe this is a Basilisk Lizard. When we got a bit closer to him, we scared him off, and he ran off at an insane speed. To our surprise, he didn't stop at the edge of the water, and continued for a few meters on the water. 

With their relatively large feet and low weight, this is how a Basilisk Lizard escapes predators. His nickname, the Jesus Lizard, is well deserved.
