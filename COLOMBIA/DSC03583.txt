On our visit to Tayrona National Park, we heard something in the trees to the left of us. Through the thick forestry, it took us a while to spot this guy, and I was barely able to take a good picture.

Then I found a spot in between the leaves with a good view to the back, and by sheer luck, he decided to crawl right up to the spot I had in view. With his piercing look, he's making sure we left peacefully after a couple of minutes and a few photos.
