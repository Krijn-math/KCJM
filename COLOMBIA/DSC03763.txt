With bright red streaks, spotting this guy wasn't difficult. And we were lucky, as he decided to do a full photo shoot for us, taking some beautiful flowers as scenery.

With the disctinctive white dot close to his beak, even more clearly visible in another picture, this is a Crimson-backed Tanager.
