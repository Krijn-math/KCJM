It's hard to describe the view of a toucan in real life. With their alien looking beaks, it must be so tough on their necks to fly!

The Keel-billed Toucan, also known as Rainbow-billed Toucan for good reason, is probably the most beautiful and famous toucan. Watching a group of them in the early morning sun with a view of the Colombian mountains is a marvelous experience.
