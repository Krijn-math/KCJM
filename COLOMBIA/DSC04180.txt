This fella is just such a cutie! Among my favourite species of birds are the hummingbirds, and among my favourite hummingbirds is this one.

I believe this one is the White-necked Jacobin, one of the more than 150 species of hummingbirds in Colombia. It turns out that Colombia has the most hummingbird species of any country in the world.
