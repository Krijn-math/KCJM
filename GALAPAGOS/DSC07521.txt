The only way to get to Isabela from Santa Cruz is by boat, which takes between two and three hours. On a bad day, the seas are so rough that you are bouncing up and down for the whole trip, leaving many of the passengers seasick.

One small advantage of rough waters is that they cause a beautiful splash in the foamy waves. It's pretty mesmerizing, as are the resulting photos.
