The Galápagos Giant Tortoise isn't born a giant. This little fella is still young and it can take up to 40 years to grow to the full-sized giants that gave the islands their name.

Luckily, he's not in a hurry to grow, as he can live for more than a century. It is thought that they originally ended up on these islands by floating all the way from the South American coast, a distance of almost 1000 kilometers!
