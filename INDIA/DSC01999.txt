Dhobi Ghat is essentially one big open air laundry in the middle of Mumbai, where all of Mumbai gets its laundry done. The people here wash clothes every day, every year, for their whole lives.

With the vibrant colours hanging in the open air, it is also a paradise for photography. Feeling more like a reporter that day, I chose to portray mostly the people living and working there.
